<h1>Access Modifier:</h1>
<br/>
<p class="speak"> Defines the access type of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed in your application. In Java, there are 4 types of access specifiers: 
public: Accessible in all classes in your application.
protected: Accessible within the package in which it is defined and in its subclass(es) (including subclasses declared outside the package).
private: Accessible only within the class in which it is defined.
default (declared/defined without using any modifier): Accessible within the same class and package within which its class is defined.
The return type: The data type of the value returned by the method or void if it does not return a value.
Method Name: The rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention is a little different.
Parameter list: Comma-separated list of the input parameters that are defined, preceded by their data type, within the enclosed parentheses. If there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses ().
Exception list: The exceptions you expect the method to throw. You can specify these exception(s).
Method body: It is the block of code, enclosed between braces, that you need to execute to perform your intended operations.</p>
